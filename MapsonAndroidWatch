Why does the watch not show turn by turn directions?


When I start turn by turn directions on my phone the watch sends an aler for each change but never launches the maps
applicaiton on the watch?

Do you know why? 

I don't either. But, I found a workaround. Configure one hardware button to launch maps. Afrer you start directions on your phone
swtich to maps on your phone by pressing the button and you will start receiveing tutn by turn dirctions! Please let me know if
there is a better way to do this!
